# Hybird Genetic Algorithm for HVRPMTIF

In this project I write a hybrid GA to solve a real problem in waste handling using Matlab programming in 2019.  

HVRPMTIF stands for Heterogenous Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Trips and Intermediate Facility. The algorithm actually written for my research paper as my undergraduate thesis project. You can read my paper [here](https://journals.ums.ac.id/index.php/jiti/article/download/8744/5015). Most of the paper written in Bahasa Indonesia.
